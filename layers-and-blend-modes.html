            <h2>The Layers Panel</h2>
            <p class="bigger-paragraph">The layers panel is something that differentiates digital painting from
                traditional painting. With layers, you can paint over a layer while still being able to change it later
                on. You can also create a new layer to experiment, and if you don't like what you did, you can
                completely scrap it without affecting the rest of your painting.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="layers-section section">
        <p class="layers-explanation">Unless you plan on painting everything on one layer, you should get to know the
            layers panel. This panel is found on the bottom right corner of the screen.
            <br><br>When you create a document, you
            will have 2 layers labeled "Paint Layer 1" and "Background." The background layer is locked by default so
            that
            you don't accidentally erase the background when you just try to erase your lines.

            <img src="images/layer-alpha-icon.png"> This is Krita's version of a clipping mask in Photoshop. If there
            are several layers grouped together,
            enabling the inherit alpha icon makes whatever is on that layer transparent if every layer below it is also
            transparent in that location.

            <h2>Blend Modes</h2>
            <p class="bigger-paragraph">Blend modes can be difficult to understand, and they are best learned by
                experimenting. Essentially, blend modes change the way colors look depending on the colors of the layer
                below it. </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="blend-modes-section section">
        <p class="blend-modes-explanation">At the top of the layers panel is a dropdown menu that allows you to change
            the blend mode of the selected layer. Blend modes are a little complicated, but they essentially change how
            the colors on the layer appears based on the colors on the layer(s) below it.
            <br><br>
            You can learn more about each blend mode on the official Krita documentation website by clicking <a
                href="https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/blending_modes.html"
                class="hover-underline-animation">here</a>, but
            the two main ones that I use for digital painting are overlay and multiply. As shown in the painting demo, I
            use overlay to lighten up the layers below it to paint light, and I use multiply to darken the layers below
            it to create shadows.
            <br><br>
            I encourage you to play around with each blend mode to see what they do to the colors on a layer.
