                        <h3>Creating a new document</h3>
                        <p>We start by creating a new document and specifying how big we want out painting to be. For
                            this
                            painting, I will use
                            a 3000px by 2000px document with a 300ppi.
                            <br><br>
                            Note that while larger documents will produce clearer paintings due to more pixels, setting
                            your document too large may create lag when painting if you're working on an older machine.
                            It's
                            easier to scale down a painting, but making a painting larger will almost always make it
                            more
                            blurry. I suggest starting at 3000px by 2000px and going from there.
                            <br><br>
                            After that, simply click "Create" to create your document.

                        <p>You should now be presented by a white canvas. To create our rough sketch, select the brush
                            tool
                            in the toolbar on the left side of the screen, which looks like a paintbrush.

                        <p>Now we will choose what our brush's mark looks like. Click on the icon on the top of the
                            screen
                            that has four small squares in it. This is where we can choose a brush preset. You can
                            experiment to see what brush you like, but I usually just use the basic opacity brush.

                            You can use the slider at the top of the screen labeled,"Size," to choose a brush size that
                            you
                            like. I will be using a size of 15px along with the color black that I selected using the

                            wheel at the top right.

                        <h3>Rough sketch</h3>
                        <p>Now we are ready to sketch! I will first create a rough sketch of my leopard. While painting,
                            you can use the + and - keys on your keyboard to zoom in and out. You can also hold down the
                            spacebar and drag with your mouse to pan across the canvas.
                            <br><br>
                            After creating my rough sketch, I realized the leopard's head is too small. To make it
                            bigger,
                            we can select that "Freehand Selection Tool" in the toolbar and draw a selection around the
                            area
                            of the leopard we want to resize. Then, we can select the "Transform a layer or selection"
                            tool
                            and resize the selection and move it around to our liking. Hold Shift if you want to
                            maintain
                            the same proportions when resizing. When you're finished, press Enter. Then deselect
                            everything by
                            going to the "Select" dropdown at the top left of the screen and click "Deselect."
                            <br><br>
                            One trick I like to use when sketching and painting is to periodically flip the canvas
                            horizontally, which makes it easier to spot mistakes. To do this, click the Image dropdown
                            at the top left of the screen and click "Mirror Image Horizontally."
                        </p>

                        <h3>Refined sketch</h3>
                        <p>For the refined sketch, I like to turn down the opacity, or "see-throughness" of the rough
                            sketch layer and the size of my brush. Make sure to create a new layer so that if you want
                            to
                            erase or change something, you can do so without affecting the rough sketch layer. You can
                            also
                            rename your layers by double clicking the name, which will help you later on if you end up
                            with
                            many
                            layers. </p>

                        <p>Now we are ready to add our inital layer of color. Create a new layer and move it below your
                            two
                            sketch layers so that your sketches show up above the colors. You can do this by simply
                            dragging
                            the layer to where you want it to be. I usually like to paint my initial layer as if there
                            is no
                            light or shadow on my subject.
                            <br><br>
                            Feel free to experiment with different brush presents and sizes.
                            <br><br>
                            For the leopard's spots, I want to be able to only draw on top of the base color so I don't
                            color outside the lines. To do this, I will group the spots and base color layer by holding
                            Shift and selecting them and pressing Ctrl + G to group them together. This doesn't do much
                            by
                            itself, but now I will enable the "Inherit Alpha" icon that looks like cursive "a" icon to
                            the
                            right of the spots layer. Now, whatever I color on the spots layer will be limited to the
                            areas
                            I already colored on the base color layer.

                    <div class="demo-text">
                        <h3>Adding shadows and light</h3>
                        <p>After painting the base color, I will start adding shadows and highlights by changing the
                            layers'
                            blend mode. Blend modes are a little complicated, but they basically change how colors on a
                            layer look based on the colors on the layers underneath it.
                            <br><br>
                            First, I will create a layer named "shadow" and another layer named "light."
                            Again, will enable the "Inherit Alpha" icon on both layers because I don't paint outside the
                            base
                            color. Make sure these layers are in the layer group we made earlier.
                            <br><br>
                            For the shadow layer, I will change the blend mode of the layer to "Multiply" from the
                            dropdown at the top of the layers panel. Now you can paint in where I want the shadows to
                            be.
                            <br><br>
                            For the light layer, the blend mode will be "Overlay," and I will use a light
                            yellowish-orange color to paint in where I want the light to be. After painting in the
                            light, I realize that I want the light to be even stronger and brighter, so I will just
                            duplicate the light layer by selecting it and clicking the second icon at the bottom of the
                            layers panel.
                            <br><br>
                            At this point, you can make your rough sketch layer invisible by clicking the eye icon to
                            the left of the layer if it's not helping you much. I will turn it off but keep the refined
                            sketch layer on until I paint in the details.

                        <h3>Adding a background</h3>
                        <p>We are pretty much finished. However, I want to create a blurry background. To do this, I
                            will first add a new layer and place it underneath everything. After loosely painting a background, I will go up to "Filter" dropdown in the top menu, hover over "Blur," and
                            click "Gaussian Blur."
                            <br><br>
                            Make sure that "Preview" is checked so that you can see the effect of the blur while you
                            move the slider. When your horizontal and vertical radius is at a place you like, click
                            "OK."
                            <br><br>
                            If you are unsure whether or not you will want to keep the blur, select "Create Filter Mask"
                            instead of "OK," which creates the blur on a new layer that you can delete later on if you
                            want.
